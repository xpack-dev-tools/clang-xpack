The [xPack GNU AArch64 Embedded GCC](https://xpack.github.io/aarch64-none-elf-gcc/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64),
**macOS** (x64 and arm64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

<Prerequisites/>

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/{{appLcName}}@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack {{appName}}** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The** xPack LLVM clang** is based on the official
[LLVM clang](https://clang.llvm.org) sources.

The current version is based on:

- LLVM clang version [{frontMatter.clang_release_version}](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#{frontMatter.clang_release_version}), from {frontMatter.clang_release_date}
- binutils {frontMatter.binutils_version}
- mingw-w64 {frontMatter.mingw_version}

For Intel Linux and Windows, multilib (32/64-bit) libraries are provided.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream, there are no major functional changes.

Since 15.0.7-4, there is a small patch in Driver.cpp that fixes the
function that computes
`InstalledDir` when clang is invoked via a link from a different folder.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

Please see the separate
[tests results page](/docs/tests/{{releaseVersion}}/).

## Documentation

The original documentation is available from
the project web site:

- https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

## Checksums
