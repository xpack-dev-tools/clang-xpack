# The xPack LLVM clang

A standalone cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) **LLVM clang**
binary distribution, intended for reproducible builds.

In addition to the the binary archives and the package meta data,
this project also includes the build scripts.

## Overview

This open source project is hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack)
and provides the platform specific binaries for the
[xPack LLVM clang](https://xpack.github.io/clang/);
it includes, in addition to project metadata, the full build scripts.

This distribution follows the official [LLVM clang](https://clang.llvm.org).

The binaries can be installed automatically as **binary xPacks** or manually as
**portable archives**.

## Release schedule

This distribution follows the official
[LLVM clang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/) releases.

The binaries can be installed automatically as **binary xPacks** or manually as
**portable archives**.

## User info

This section is intended as a shortcut for those who plan
to use the LLVM clang binaries. For full details please read the
[xPack LLVM clang](https://xpack.github.io/clang/) pages.

### Supported languages

The xPack LLVM clang binaries include support for C/C++ and the LLVM utilities.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install LLVM clang is using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/clang`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/clang)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

#### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

It is recommended to update to the latest version with:

```sh
npm install --location=global xpm@latest
```

For details please follow the instructions in the
[xPack install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

#### Install

With the `xpm` tool available, installing
the latest version of the package is quite easy:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Only at first use.

xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/clang@latest

ls -l xpacks/.bin
```

This command will:

- install the latest available version,
into the central xPacks store, if not already there
- add symbolic links (`.cmd` forwarders on Windows) into
the local `xpacks/.bin` folder to the central store

The central xPacks store is a platform dependent
folder; check the output of the `xpm` command for the actual
folder used on your platform).
This location is configurable via the environment variable
`XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER`; for more details please check the
[xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/folders/) page.

xPacks aware tools automatically
identify binaries installed with
`xpm` and provide a convenient method to manage paths.

#### Uninstall

To remove the links created by xpm in the current project:

```sh
cd my-project

xpm uninstall @xpack-dev-tools/clang
```

To completely remove the package from the global store:

```sh
xpm uninstall --global @xpack-dev-tools/clang
```

### Manual install

For all platforms, the **xPack LLVM clang**
binaries are released as portable
archives that can be installed in any location.

The archives can be downloaded from the
GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack/releases/)
page.

For more details please read the
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/clang/install/) page.

### Versioning

The version strings used by the LLVM project are three number strings
like `14.0.6`; to this string the xPack distribution adds a four number,
but since semver allows only three numbers, all additional ones can
be added only as pre-release strings, separated by a dash,
like `14.0.6-2`. When published as a npm package, the version gets
a fifth number, like `14.0.6-2.1`.

Since adherence of third party packages to semver is not guaranteed,
it is recommended to use semver expressions like `^14.0.6` and `~14.0.6`
with caution, and prefer exact matches, like `14.0.6-2.1`.
