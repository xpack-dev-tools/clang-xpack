### Check the latest upstream release

The latest releases must have been announced in
LLVM [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/).
Find the latest release that seems stable, usually
like {versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.6,
sometimes {versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.7,
even {versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.8.

Compare the latest upstream release with the latest xPack
[release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack/releases/).
If necessary, update the triplet, otherwise increase the fourth number,
as below.
