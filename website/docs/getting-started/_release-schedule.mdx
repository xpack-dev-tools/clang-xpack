## Release schedule

This distribution generally follows the official
LLVM clang [releases](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/),
which are 2 major releases per year.

Given that between the major releases there are 5-8
intermediate releases
(spaced 2 weeks apart),
only the final patch of each minor version is retained
(like {versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.[5678]).
The rule is to wait for the new upstream release
(like {versionMajor()+1}.{versionMinor()}.0), and
release the previous one ({versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.[5678])

However, in order to spot possible issues, it is recommended to run
builds as soon as new versions are available
(like {versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.1),
without making public releases.
