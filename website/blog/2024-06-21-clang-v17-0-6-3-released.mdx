Version **17.0.6-3** is a maintenance release; it fixes the arm 32-bit binaries.

<!-- truncate -->

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

The [xPack LLVM clang](https://xpack.github.io/clang/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[LLVM clang](https://clang.llvm.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64),
**macOS** (x64 and arm64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Prerequisites

- x64 GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.27** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 18 or later, Debian 10 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
  Fedora 29 or later, etc)
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.27** or higher
  (like Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu 18 or later, Debian 10 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
  Fedora 29 or later, etc)
- x64 Windows: Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)),
  Windows 8, Windows 10

- arm64 macOS: 11.6 or later

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack LLVM clang** on various platforms
are presented in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack LLVM clang generally follows the official
[LLVM clang](https://clang.llvm.org) releases.

The current version is based on:

- LLVM clang version [{frontMatter.clang_version}](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#{frontMatter.clang_version}), from {frontMatter.clang_date}.

For Intel Linux and Windows, multilib (32/64-bit) libraries are provided.

## LLVM libraries

On macOS and Windows the compiler defaults are set to the LLVM libraries
(`libc++` and `compiler-rt`).

For historical reasons, on GNU/Linux, the defaults are set to the host
system (`libstdc++` and `glibc`).

To use the LLVM libraries, add the following options:

```sh
-stdlib=libc++ -rtlib=compiler-rt -lunwind
```

For LTO builds, also use LLD:

```sh
-flto -fuse-ld=lld
```

## `-m32` / `-m64`

For Intel Linux and Windows, multilib libraries are provided
and can be selected using the `-m32` / `-m64` options.

## `-print-search-dirs`

Since the toolchain can be installed in any location, and the binaries
compiled with it need to access the libraries, it is necessary to
get the actual path and pass it via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and/or
set the `-rpath`.

This can be achieved by querying the compiler
for `-print-search-dirs` and processing the output.

For example, for the 32-bit libraries:

```sh
${CXX} -m32 -print-search-dirs | grep 'libraries: =' | sed -e 's|libraries: =||'
```

On Windows the DLLs are usually in `bin`, but for consistency within GCC,
they are also copied to `lib`; it is recommended to ask the compiler for
the actual path.

For example, for the 32-bit libraries:

```sh
${CXX} -m32 -print-file-name=libc++.dll
```

## Changes

Compared to the upstream, there are no major functional changes.

Since 15.0.7-4, there is a small patch in Driver.cpp that fixes the
function that computes
`InstalledDir` when clang is invoked via a link from a different folder.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

Please see the separate
[tests results page](/docs/tests/17.0.6-3/).

## Documentation

The original documentation is available
[online](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html).

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

## Deprecation notices

### Linux minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is **GLIBC 2.27**, available starting
with Ubuntu 18, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.
Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022.

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit Intel Linux and Intel Windows was
dropped in 2022.

### Pre-deprecation notice for 32-bit Arm Linux

Due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems,
support for 32-bit Arm Linux (armv7l) will be preserved
for a little while, but expect it to be dropped by 2025,
so it is recommended to consider an upgrade to a RPi 4 or 5 with
at least 4 GB (preferably 8 GB) of RAM.

## Pre-deprecation notice for Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS _Bionic Beaver_ reached the end of the standard five-year
maintenance window for Long-Term Support (LTS) release on 31 May 2023.

As a courtesy, the xPack GNU/Linux releases will continue to be based on
Ubuntu 18.04 for another year.

From 2025 onwards, the GNU/Linux binaries will be built on **Debian 10**,
(**GLIBC 2.28**), and are also expected to run on RedHat 8.

Users are urged to update their build and test infrastructure to
ensure a smooth transition to the next xPack releases.
