Version **15.0.7-2** is a maintenance release; it fixes the missing run-time libraries in the macOS binaries.

The [xPack LLVM clang](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/clang-xpack/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[LLVM clang](https://clang.llvm.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64),
**macOS** (x64, arm64)
and **GNU/Linux** (x64, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

:::

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Prerequisites

- x64 GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.27** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 18 or later, Debian 10 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
  Fedora 29 or later, etc)
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.27** or higher
  (like Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu 18 or later, Debian 10 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
  Fedora 29 or later, etc)
- x64 Windows: Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)),
  Windows 8, Windows 10
- x64 macOS: 10.13 or later
- arm64 macOS: 11.6 or later

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/clang@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack LLVM clang** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack LLVM clang generally follows the official
[LLVM clang](https://clang.llvm.org) releases.

The current version is based on:

- LLVM clang version [{frontMatter.clang_version}](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#{frontMatter.clang_version}), from {frontMatter.clang_date}.

The defaults are set to `libc++` and `compiler-rt`.

For x64 GNU/Linux and Windows, multilib (32/64-bit) libraries are provided.

## LLVM libraries

The compiler defaults are set to  use the LLVM libraries
(`libc++` and `compiler-rt`).

## `-m32` / `-m64`

For x64 GNU/Linux and Windows, multilib libraries are provided
and can be selected using the `-m32` / `-m64` options.

## `-print-search-dirs`

Since the toolchain can be installed in any location, and the binaries
compiled with it need to access the libraries, it is necessary to
get the actual path and pass it via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and/or
set the `-rpath`.

This can be achieved by querying the compiler
for `-print-search-dirs` and processing the output.

For example, for the 32-bit libraries:

```sh
${CXX} -m32 -print-search-dirs | grep 'libraries: =' | sed -e 's|libraries: =||'
```

On Windows this might be slightly more complicated, to get rid of the
letter part of the paths.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream, there are no functional changes.

## Bug fixes

- [#8] due to an issue in the build scripts, some of the less used
  compiler run-time libraries were missing from the macOS binaries; fixed

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- on macOS, the `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1`
  was added to the include path; unfortunately this may crash some builds;
  removed in 15.0.7-3
- on GNU/Linux, for consistency with macOS and Windows, in 15.9.7-[12]
  the defaults were changed from GNU libstdc++ to clang libc++; unfortunately
  this breaks some tools that probe various compiler capabilities (like meson);
  the defaults on GNU/Linux were reverted to libstdc++ in 15.0.7-3
- when clang is invoked via a link from a different folder, the `InstalledDir`
  does not reflect the correct install folder, and the new clang system headers
  are either not found or the host system headers are used; fixed in 15.0.7-4
- in certain conditions, the binaries compiled with `-flto` may fail

## Documentation

The original documentation is available
[online](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html).

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/clang-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux and x86 Windows was
dropped in 2022. Support for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux (armv7l) will be preserved
for a while, due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems.

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022 and the
minimum requirement was raised to GLIBC 2.27, available starting
with Ubuntu 18, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.
